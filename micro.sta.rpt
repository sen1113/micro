Info: Running Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 11.0 Build 208 07/03/2011 Service Pack 1 SJ Web Edition
    Info: Processing started: Wed Nov 26 03:42:30 2014
Info: Command: quartus_sta micro -c micro
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Warning: Parallel compilation is not licensed and has been disabled
Critical Warning: Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'micro.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info: No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Info: The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Warning: No clocks defined in design.
Info: No clocks to report
Info: No fmax paths to report
Info: No Setup paths to report
Info: No Hold paths to report
Info: No Recovery paths to report
Info: No Removal paths to report
Info: No Minimum Pulse Width paths to report
Info: The selected device family is not supported by the report_metastability command.
Info: Design is fully constrained for setup requirements
Info: Design is fully constrained for hold requirements
Info: Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 3 warnings
    Info: Peak virtual memory: 233 megabytes
    Info: Processing ended: Wed Nov 26 03:42:31 2014
    Info: Elapsed time: 00:00:01
